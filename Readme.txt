Here we provide supplementary material for the paper "R&D location strategies" authored by Luca Colombo, Herbert Dawid and Philipp Harting.

In the folder Model, one can find the Java implementation of the simulation model used for the paper. For additional information, see the Readme file there.

In the folder Replication, we provide some additional scripts and software that should in principle allow the reader to replicate the experiments. It should, however, be noted that we ran the simulations on a parallel cluster with a large number of cores. Some of the experiments are computationally quite heavy, and it is recommended, if available,
to run the experiments on a large multi core computer. For further information, see the Readme file there.
